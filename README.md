# Rapid-evolution-of-a-sexually-selected-trait

This is a series of analyses and data visualizations for my PhD research using R markdown in RStudio.

The goal was to first identify a trait under sexual selection in my study species, the small Indian mongoose 
(Urva auropunctata), in populations from its native range of India. Then, I wanted to compare the trait and its
characteristics to several introduced populations (Hawaii, Jamaica, Mauritius, and St. Croix) to determine
if the trait had evolved in response to the different ecological conditions of the introduced locations.
